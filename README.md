# Cypress + Docker + Jenkins CI-CD

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Cypress**, **Docker**, and **Jenkins** to implement a **continuous integration and delivery pipeline**.

The main components are:

- **Cypress:** End-to-end testing framework.
- **Docker:** Containerizing the application and test environment.
- **Jenkins:** Automating the pipeline â€” build, test, and deploy â€” upon each code change.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Run **Cypress Tests Inside Docker Container**
- Integrate Tests into a **Jenkins pipeline**
- Continuous delivery upon commits
- Easily reproducible and isolated environment thanks to Docker
